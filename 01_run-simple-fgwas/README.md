# Run FGWAS manually

Protocol to run a FGWAS with imputations according to Guan, *et al.* (2025).

1. Define (`$ export VAR="path/to/file"`) the next variables:
    - `OUTDIR`: Path of the directory that will save the outputs.
    - `BED`: Path to the directory with the observed genotypes with **no extension** (e.g. `/path/to/genotype`)
    - `KIN`: Path to the kinship file generated by KING.
    - `BASE`: Path to MCPS baseline survey that will be used in the protocol.
    - `CHR_RANGE`: Range of chromosomes in that will be used in the analysis (e.g. `export CHR_RANGE="1 5 17-20"`)

2. Once you have the global variables in your SHELL session, you can execute *in order* (and if necessary) the `.sh` scripts.

    ```
    1. ./segment_genotype.sh
    2. ./run_ibd.sh (optional)
    3. ./run_imputation.sh (optional)
    4. ./fgwas/<script>
    ```
